    <h1>Bike Safety in Boston</h1>

    <p>The <a href='http://www.bostonarearesearchinitiative.net/'>Boston Area Research Initiative</a> recently released a <a href='http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/BARI/faces/study/StudyPage.xhtml?globalId=doi:10.7910/DVN/24713&studyListingIndex=0_b7dfc61cc86a188efbdb4ab5c2a9'>dataset of all bicycle crashes from 2009-2012</a>. There were several <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2014/06/18/bike-crash-map-boston-data/">articles</a> <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2014/06/19/cyclists-beware-this-new-map-shows-bike-crash-hotspots-across-boston/mGiHsi6gOIPLvgJjBw1yFJ/story.html">and</a> <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/uploads/16776_49_15_27.pdf">analyses</a> published, but the <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/uploads/16776_49_15_27.pdf">official City of Boston report</a> did not consider "impact adding bike lanes, shared lanes or cycletracks had on cyclist collisions", and "recommended that future analysis begin to look" into it.<p>

    <p>One other factor the City of Boston report didn't consider in depth was the total traffic through an area. The number of collisions might be large along a particular street or intersection, but is that because the street is dangerous, or because there is simply a lot of traffic?<p>

    <p>We combined the <a href='http://www.cityofboston.gov/bikes/statistics.asp'>BARI dataset</a> with <a href="">data released for Hubhacks</a> by <a href='http://runkeeper.com'>Runkeeper</a>, a smartphone application that tracks your runs and bicycle rides, to try to get a sense of the likelihood of collisions adjusted for traffic. And we used <a href='http://maps.cityofboston.gov/ArcGIS/rest/services/BaseServices/Bike_network/MapServer'>City of Boston bike lane data</a> to determine how many of those collisions and rides occurred on bike lanes, to get a sense of how much they help.</p>
